# What? You have rules?

As copied from our about page:

> These are (almost) completely uncensored forums. While we do have to comply with united states law (no calls to violence) and we're not complete assholes (we'll censor names and identifying information) we strive to keep this an open place for people from a certain community that I will neglect to name.

# Ok, those rules make sense. How do I follow them?

##### It's easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Write your post
	* Jane is sad.

2. Censor out names and identifying information using the method of your choice (we recommend asterisks, or, if you have multiple people, use a psudonym)
	* ***** is sad.
	* Jill (name changed) is sad.

3. Hit submit and wait for someone to verify that you've done this. We debated for a long time about if this was a step we needed to include but decided that, to protect this from as many takedown attempts as possible, we needed to enforce the rules.
