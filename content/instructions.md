# How to use TerracottaEarth

# So how do we share and discuss our ideas? 
You have a few options here!
1. Submit an anonymous post to our submission box and wait for a moderator to verify that you've complied with TerracottaEarth’s policy. It can be an article, a question, or anything that you think is an issue that needs to be discussed by the community.
2. Comment! The comments below submissions are all anonymous, and we highly encourage active and respectful discussion. After all, that is the entire purpose of TerracottaEarth.

# What’s the deal with the discussion and humor pages?
We don’t just want TerracottaEarth to be serious. The discussion page will be dedicated towards serious topics, question, articles, and concerns about the certain community we will neglect to name, while the humor page will be for things like political-esque cartoons, memes, jokes, photos, and more!

# So what exactly are we supposed to talk about on here?
The goal of TerracottaEarth is to provide an anonymous platform for  members of a certain community we will neglect to name to discuss the flaws they see in the community. Article topics can range from mental health support to sexual assault to potentially unfair grading and college prospects. You can also send in open ended questions to start a discussion you think is necessary! Respond to other people’s content respectfully. Remember, we’re all part of the same community.
