# What is TerracottaEarth?

The objective of TerracottaEarth is to provide an uncensored platform for participants to anonymously express their viewpoints without the threat of academic repercussions and further intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.
1. These are almost completely uncensored forums.
2. The founders and moderators of TerracottaEarth must legally comply with United States law.
3. Names and any other identifying markers will be censored or removed.
4. TerracottaEarth will strive to maintain itself as an open place for members of a certain community we will neglect to name.


# Who is behind TerracottaEarth?

The entire purpose of TerracottaEarth is to maintain our promise of anonymity. Therefore, our identities will not be disclosed, just like yours. We have no accounts or identifying information, as is the goal of this platform.


# What protections on my privacy are there?

First of all, what you choose not to tell us, we won’t know. If there are any concerns about information collecting, the founders recommend you use a VPN or Tor. Secondly, all of TerracottaEarth’s code will remain open source; if you wish to verify that we aren’t collecting data for yourself you can go over it.
