# What is this?

These are (almost) completely uncensored forums. While we do have to comply with united states law (no calls to violence) and we're not complete assholes (we'll censor names and identifying information) we strive to keep this an open place for people from a certain community that I will neglect to name.


# Who are we?

That's the whole point. You don't need to know, and we don't need to know who you are. We have no accounts, no identifying information, just uncensored. Actually uncensored.


# What protections on my privacy are there?

Firstly, what you don't tell us we can't know. Use a VPN or Tor if you're worried about us collecting information fthat way (you should be doing that anyway, honestly). Secondly, all our code is open source, meaning that if you want to verify that we're not collecting any data you can.
